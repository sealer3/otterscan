# Running Otterscan (other methods)

## (Alternative 1) Build Otterscan docker image locally and run it

If you don't want to download from Docker Hub, you can build the docker image from the sources and run it.

If you just want to build the image locally, there is no need to install the development toolchain, just make sure you have a recent working Docker installation.

This method requires only `git` and `docker`.

The entire build process will take place inside the docker multi-stage build.

Clone Otterscan repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/wmitsuda/otterscan.git
cd otterscan
npm run docker-build
```

This will run the entire build process inside a build container, merge the production build of the React app with pre-made assets from `otterscan-assets` project into the same image format it is published in Docker Hub, but locally under the name `otterscan`.

Then you can start/stop it using the commands:

```
npm run docker-start
<browse locally on http://localhost:5273>
npm run docker-stop
```

## (Alternative 2) Run a development build from the source

First, a brief explanation about the app:

- The app itself is a simple React app which will be run locally and communicates with your Erigon node.
- The app makes use of external data sources, like icons, signatures, etc. They require you to run a separate process to serve them. They are made available as a nginx Docker image.

These instructions are subjected to changes in future for the sake of simplification.

Make sure you have a working node 16/npm 8 installation.

By default, it assumes your `erigon` processs is serving requests at `http://localhost:8545` and it has a beacon chain REST API serving requests at `http://localhost:3500`.

You can customize these URLs by creating a `.env.development.local` file at the root of the repository (automatically git ignored) and adding the following entries:

```
VITE_ERIGON_URL=<your-erigon-JSON-RPC-endpoint>
VITE_BEACON_API_URL=<your-beacon-chain-REST-API-endpoint>
```

Start serving the assets server by running the following Docker image:

```
npm run assets-start
```

To stop it, run:

```
npm run assets-stop
```

> By default they run at http://localhost:5175

To run Otterscan development build:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Otterscan should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## (Alternative 3) Run a production build from a simple Python Flask server
Hosting Otterscan is similar to hosting a basic HTTP server except that any files that aren't found are served `index.html`. It's easy to host from a simple Flask server like this.

Start by installing Flask via `pip`:

```
pip install flask
```

Build production scripts and assets to the `dist` folder:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

Edit `public/config.json` with the correct configuration parameters

Run the Flask server on port 5173:
```
flask --app scripts/flask_server.py run -p 5173
```
